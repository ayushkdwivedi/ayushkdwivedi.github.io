<p>I am a research scholar (Ph.D.) at Signal Processing and Communication research Centre <a href="http://spcrc.iiit.ac.in" target="_blank">(SPCRC)</a>, International Institute of Information Technology <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">(IIIT)</a>, Hyderabad. I am working under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/" target="_blank" >Dr. Sachin Chaudhari</a>. I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering (E.C.E) graduate currently working in the field of wireless communication. 

<p>My area of interest for research is next generation wireless communication. At present I am reading hybrid satellite-terrestial communication complementing 5G network. Previously I have done under graduation project on basic antenna designs. I have also designed music recommender system using machine learning as part of coursework in SMAI course at IIIT. I am interested in exploring possibilies of using machine learning in next generation wireless communication.</p>
